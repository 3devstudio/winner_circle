              does not include the loading, unloading, handling, feeding,

              if Carrier's agents or employees at the request of Shipper or the
              one receiving said animal(s) assist in the loading or unloading of
              animal(s), the Shipper and/or the individual receiving said

              3.2 Limitation of Liability
            </h3>
            <p>
              Carrier's maximum liability for the death of, injury or damage to,
              or delay in the transportation of any animal shall be the Agreed
              Value of such animal. Carrier does not provide insurance for
              Shipper’s goods. Carrier assumes the liability of a common carrier
              subject to the provisions of 49 U.S.C. 14706.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.2.1 Shipper shall release and discharge Carrier from all
              liability from any cause whatsoever, unless such delay, injuries,
              or loss shall be caused by Carrier, or by the negligence of
              Carrier's agents or employees, and in either event, Carrier shall
              be liable only to the extent of actual damage sustained, but in no
              event an amount greater than the Agreed Value for the animal(s) in
              question.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.2.2 Shipper shall declare the Agreed Value of each animal (which
              at Shipper's option may be any value up to and including the full
              value of the animal) at or prior to commencement of transportation
              of the Shipment on the paper or electronic bill of lading under
              the column heading "AGREED VALUE OF EACH ANIMAL ($5000 UNLESS
              DECLARED OTHERWISE)" or similar language.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.2.3 If the Shipper fails or declines to agree to a value and
              specify same on the bill of lading, and fails to sign the bill of
              lading, the Shipment will not be accepted. If the Shipment is
              inadvertently accepted by Carrier without an Agreed Value stated
              or a signature by Shipper on the bill of lading, the Carrier's
              maximum liability will be $5000 per animal.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.2.4 If the Shipper individually or through its agent signs
              Carrier's paper or electronic bill of lading but fails to state an
              Agreed Value on Carrier's bill of lading for any animal at or
              prior to commencement of transportation, Carrier's maximum
              liability for each such animal shall be $5000.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.2.5 The Agreed Value shall be deemed to relate to each animal
              separately and not to the Shipment as a whole.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.2.6 If the Agreed Value declared by Shipper on the bill of
              lading does not exceed $5000, Carrier's charges for the Shipment
              shall be based on Carrier's Established Rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              3.2.7 If the Agreed Value declared by Shipper on the bill of
              lading exceeds $5000, Carrier's charges for the Shipment shall be
              based on Carrier's Established Rate plus an excess value charge of
              $2.00 for each $100.00 or fraction thereof of excess value per
              animal for each 100 miles or fraction thereof of distance from
              point of origin to point of destination as determined in
              accordance with Section 4.4 of these Terms and Conditions of
              Shipment (subject to a minimum excess value charge of $200.00 per
              animal).

            <p>
              4.1 Warranty of Shipper. Shipper individually or through Shipper's

              4.2 Persons Bound. The provisions contained within these Terms and
              Conditions of Shipment and Carrier's paper or electronic bill of

              parties hereto, all Beneficial Owners of the property identified
              herein, and all Carriers handling the Shipment or any part thereof
              and shall apply to any return or reconsignment of the Shipment.
              The Shipper (including all Beneficial Owners of the Shipment) and
              each consignee shall be jointly and severally liable for payment
              of Carrier's lawful charges.

              4.3 U.S. Currency. Rates and charges are stated and payable in
              U.S. dollars and cents.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.4 Determination of Mileage. Where Carrier's rates are based on
              the number of miles an animal is transported, mileage shall be
              determined by Carrier using the most convenient mileage guide
              available. The actual number of miles traveled via the Carrier's
              routing from origin to destination as determined by Carrier will
              apply unless the Shipper requests transportation via a longer
              route, in which event the number of miles via the route requested
              by Shipper shall apply.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.5 Carrier Convenience/Interline Arrangements. Carrier makes no
              warranty, expressed or implied, any animal(s) will be transported
              on any particular schedule, will be loaded, delivered or
              transported at any particular time, on any particular equipment or
              by any particular Carrier. Carrier further retains the right, at
              its option, to deliver shipper’s animal(s) to other individuals or
              entities for all or a portion of a trip, taking into
              consideration, without limitation, earlier delivery to ultimate
              destination, the safety and well-being of the animal(s), reduction
              or elimination of layover time and the costs and inconvenience to
              Shipper or animal(s).
            </p>
            <p>
              4.6 Limitation of Service. The Carrier is not obligated to
              transport property for which it does not have suitable or
              sufficient equipment, nor to accept Shipments except as equipment
              is available.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.7 Impractical/Unsafe Operations. Transportation service will not
              be performed where conditions of roadways, streets, alleys or
              premises over which vehicles must operate are such that in
              Carrier's judgment it is impractical or unsafe to operate. If at
              any time in the judgment of Carrier it is impractical or unsafe to
              deliver or to continue transporting a Shipment or any part
              thereof, Carrier shall make a reasonable effort to notify the
              Shipper, and upon notification Shipper may elect to reconsign the
              Shipment or affected part thereof as set forth in 4:16. If after
              making a reasonable effort Carrier has been unable to provide
              notification to Shipper as contemplated by this Section 4.7 or if
              upon notification Shipper fails or declines to reconsign the
              Shipment or affected part thereof, the Shipment or affected part
              thereof shall thereupon be deemed to have been tendered for
              delivery and the provisions of Section 4.16 of these Terms and
              Conditions of Shipment shall apply.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.8 Cancellation of Service. When a request for service is placed
              by Shipper for transportation service, and, due to no fault of
              Carrier, the cancellation of such request for service is not made
              prior to Carrier’s dispatch vehicle, a charge of $1.00 per mile
              (but in no event less than $ 200.00) will be assessed and computed
              from the point of dispatch to the point of origin and return to
              the point of dispatch.
            </p>
            <p>
              4.9 Claims. Claims for loss or damage are governed by the
              provisions of 49 C.F.R. 370. Claims for duplicate payment and
              overcharges are governed by the provisions of 49 C.F.R. 378. As a

              the animal(s), the cost of any necessary veterinary expense shall
              be borne by the Shipper and is not included in Carrier's
              Established Rate. All other charges incidental to international
              border crossings including user fees shall be borne by Shipper and

              freight and other lawful charges including a reasonable charge for
              stable rent . Carrier may at any time or times thereafter sell
              said animal(s) and/or paraphernalia or any number of them, at
              public or private sale, with or without notice, as Carrier may
              deem necessary, and apply the proceeds arising therefrom, or so

              condition of Carrier's paper or electronic bill of lading or these
              Terms and Conditions of Shipment shall be held to be
              unenforceable, the remaining parts, portions, terms or conditions
              thereof shall nevertheless continue to be valid and enforceable as
              though the invalid or unenforceable part, portion, term or
              condition had not been included.

              5.1 Loading in Excess of Capacity. Where the Shipper at Shipper's
              own risk deems it necessary to ship a number of animals (other
              than thoroughbred or standard bred racehorses and show horses)
              which exceed normal vehicle capacity and the bill of lading is
              stamped or so marked, Shipper may obtain such service.
            </p>
            <p>
              5.2 Exclusive Use of Vehicle. When at the request of Shipper a
              Vehicle is used exclusively for the transportation of a Shipment
              provided by such Shipper, Shipper is to contact Carrier for
              pricing.
            </p>
            <p>
              5.3 Reconsignment or Diversion. At the request of Shipper, Carrier

            </p>
            <p>
              5.3.2 The party requesting reconsignment or diversion shall be
              responsible for all communication expenses incurred by the Carrier
              in an attempt to effect a reconsignment or diversion, regardless
              whether Carrier's efforts are successful.
            </p>

              5.3.3 When change in destination of the Shipment is involved, the

              5.4 Requirement for Box Stall. Should the Shipper or the Carrier

              being defined as a stall the entire width of the vehicle
              (approximately ten feet wide by six feet deep) the rate for one
              box stall will be up to $2.00 per mile. One mare and its foal will
              be subject to a minimum charge of $1.50 per mile time. Where the
              Carrier provides one or more box stalls solely for the Carrier's
              own convenience without regard to the particular requirements of
              such animal and without request of the Shipper, the provisions of
              this Section 5.4 shall not apply.
            </p>

              stopped in transit at any point or place at the request of Shipper
              or Shipper’s agent for the purpose of partial loading or unloading
              of animals or retrieval of documents, tack, pets, paraphernalia,
              etc., the following provisions apply:
            </p>
            <p>
              5.5.1 The Carrier’s bill of lading must show the point or points
              at which the Shipment is to be stopped for partial loading or
              unloading together with a complete description of the animals to
              be loaded or unloaded at each point and the name and address of
              the party to whom each animal is to be delivered. If delivery is
              made to more than one address in the same city, town or village,
              each delivery will be considered a separate stop in the
              application of this section.

            <p>
              5.5.2 The substitution of animals other than those animals

              the use, operation, maintenance or control of cargo or motor
              vehicle equipment the attendant may have against Carrier, its
              agents, employees, officers, successors and assigns. Further, each

              5.6.3 Indemnification of Carrier. The shipper personally and where

              and every nature arising out of any personal injury or death, or
              loss or damage of any and every kind or nature sustained by an
              attendant or attendants requested or supplied by shipper or
              shipper's agent while in, upon or about the vehicle of the carrier
              or incurred while acting as attendant for the aforementioned
              animals.
